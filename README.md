## Overview of Analysis
The purposed of this analysis is compare the temparatures between June and December for surf analysis over the data set of 7 years (2010 to 2017)
## Results
From the data set pulled, the following subsets were pulled for December and June across all years and all stations. This data is summarized in the below charts:

Looking at the statistics there are some key differences to highlight:
(1) The overall amount of observations is significantly lower between the two months. This could be that data wasn't collected due to holidays (Christmas and New Year's Eve) and particular stations.
(2) The mean temperatures are not too far apart meaning that there is potential to stay open longer.
(3) The highs are very similar, but there is defintely a lower 25% that is colder. December will have some days that are much colder to be open and would need to be monitored.
